# Design_of_Integrative_Automotive_electronics_Model

This is the integrated model of 5 different automotive systems used inside a car:
1. HVAC System
2. Wiper System
3. Lighting System (Headlights and Rearlights)
4. Power Windows
5. Central Locking System

i.   Design of the Individual systems in simulink
ii.  Integrated all the systems inside to make one complete system
iii. Created the python file to generate all the possible testcases to verify the model
iv.  Verified the integrated model using the generated testcases
v.   Designed a embedded model using Embedded-C for all the individuals systems and integrated system
vi.  Simulated the embedded model to verify the functionality
vii. Verified the HVAC system using Arduino UNO
